00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,720
CNN has decided not to run a
Donald Trump endorsed campaign

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,960
ad after the network decided it
does not meet their standards.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,480
The 32nd advertisement paid for
by Trump's campaign targeted Joe

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,930
Biden's conduct toward Ukraine
while he served as vice president,

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,100
while also referring to CNN
personalities Don lemon, Chris Cuomo

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,420
and Jim Acosta as media lapdogs.
A CNN spokesperson spoke to

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,110
saying the ad does not meet the
network's advertising standards,

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,500
adding in addition to disparaging
CNN and its journalists,

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,680
the ad makes assertions that have
been proven demonstrably false by

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,820
various news outlets, including CNN.
However, despite CNN's rejection,

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,520
the president posted the
advertisement onto his Twitter page

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,940
last week along with the caption
I'm draining the swamp now.

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,420
This is not the first time CNN
has rejected a Trump campaign ad.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,350
Back in 2017, the network refused
to run a Trump approved ad called

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,770
Let President Trump Do His Job,
which criticized the media and

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,310
specifically called out lemon,
