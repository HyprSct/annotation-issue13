1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,220
I think if you're a leader and
you don't understand the terms

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,260
that you're using,
that's probably the first start.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,920
It's really important that as, uh,
a leader in the organization, you

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,910
understand what digitization means.
You take the time to read widely

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,890
in the sector.
There are a lot of really good books.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,400
Kevin Kelly, who started Wide
Magazine, has written a great,

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,220
uh, great book on, uh,
on various technologies.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,500
I think understanding the
technologies, understanding

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,040
what's out there so that you can
separate the hype from the hope is

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,630
really an important first step,
and then making sure you understand

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,090
the relevance of that for your
function and how that fits into

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,840
your business is the second.
Step, I think, to two simple,

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,680
uh, suggestions.
You know, one one is I love the

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,360
phrase brilliant at the basics.
Right.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,510
So, you know, how can you become
brilliant at the basics?

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,590
But beyond that, um, you know,
the fundamental thing I've seen

17
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,520
which hasn't changed is so few
organizations, as a first step,

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,270
have truly taken control of their
spend data, you know, as a key first

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,590
step on a digital transformation,
taking ownership of data.

20
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,520
And that's not a decision to use
one vendor over someone else

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,340
that says we are going to be
completely data driven.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,380
We're going to try and be as
real time as possible.

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,380
And we're we're going to be able
to explain that data to anyone

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,670
the way they want to see it.
Understand why you're doing it.

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,690
And then the second thing is reach
out to suppliers in the market,

26
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,380
talk to them, collaborate with them.
You'll get a much better outcome.

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,900
Think about what outcome you want
at the end instead of thinking

28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,160
about the different processes
and the software names.

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,320
So e sourcing being one of 20,
think big and be brave.

30
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,050
I think um, and talk to technology
vendors because rather than just

31
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,000
sending them forms we won't bite.
You know I think we should

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,170
fundamentally all of us rethink
how procurement should be done

33
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,580
and then start to define the
functionality that we need and

34
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,090
how we can make this work. Yeah.
What we're doing today is

35
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:18,120
absolutely well, we don't like it.
Procurement people don't like it.

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,130
Our colleagues don't like it.
Nobody wants it. Yeah.

37
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,260
And we spending a huge amount of
money for no reason.
